<p>Linkclump is a browser extension that enables selection and action on multiple links at once for faster link handling.</p>
</div>
<h1>Linkclump Overview</h1> <p>Linkclump is a browser extension that allows users to handle multiple links simultaneously within web pages by dragging a selection box. Users can open links in new tabs or windows, copy link URLs to the clipboard, or save them as bookmarks. This tool improves link management workflows in browser environments. Linkclump works with Windows based Chromium browsers like Google Chrome and other Chromium based browsers. It is distributed as a free extension and does not require a separate installation program outside the browser environment. The extension enhances browser navigation efficiency for users dealing with large sets of hyperlinks.</p> <h2>Purpose of Linkclump</h2> <p>The primary purpose of Linkclump is to simplify the repetitive task of opening, copying, or bookmarking many links. Instead of clicking links one by one, users can draw a box around multiple items to activate predefined actions on all selected links. This accelerates workflows when browsing search results, reference lists, ecommerce pages, or directory pages.</p> <h2>Main Features</h2> <ul> <li>Drag selection box for multi link selection on a web page.</li> <li>Open selected links as new tabs or in a new window.</li> <li>Copy URLs of selected links to clipboard for external use.</li> <li>Bookmark selected links to browser bookmarks.</li> <li>Custom activation method using combinations of mouse buttons and modifier keys such as Shift, Ctrl or Alt.</li> <li>Smart link filtering to include or exclude links based on keywords.</li> <li>Auto scroll to include all links in long web pages during selection.</li> <li>Delay configuration to control link opening speed.</li> </ul> <h2>Unique Characteristics</h2> <p>Linkclump provides a natural extension of browser selection behavior with visual feedback while dragging. Users can configure multiple action profiles and adjust settings per workflow. The Smart Select function attempts to select only meaningful links within content, avoiding page navigation or non link elements.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Linkclump is designed for users who frequently work with sets of links in the browser. This includes researchers, content curators, marketers, web analysts, ecommerce professionals, and general web users requiring rapid link handling during browsing sessions.</p> <h2>Advantages of Using Linkclump</h2> <ul> <li>Eliminates repetitive clicking for large sets of links.</li> <li>Saves time when opening multiple search results or links lists.</li> <li>Customizable link actions improve flexibility for different browsing scenarios.</li> <li>Link filters help to focus on relevant items.</li> </ul> <h2>Functional Modules</h2> <p>The Linkclump extension includes modules for user input interpretation, selection box drawing, link extraction from page DOM, action execution (open, copy, bookmark), settings management, and browser integration. The input handler monitors mouse and key combinations and initiates the selection box rendering. The selection processor identifies link elements within the box and applies configured actions. Browser APIs handle tab creation, clipboard interaction, and bookmark folder creation.</p> <h2>System Requirements</h2> <p>Linkclump runs as a browser extension and requires a modern Chromium based browser with extension support. There is no separate Windows application. Users must run a supported browser such as Google Chrome or other Chromium based browsers on Windows.</p> <h2>Supported Platforms</h2> <p>Linkclump functions on Windows and other operating systems that support Chrome or Chromium based browsers. It is not a standalone native program but requires a browser environment to operate.</p> <h2>Algorithms and Mechanisms</h2> <p>Linkclump uses DOM traversal and event listening to detect link elements within user drawn selection boxes. It uses browser extension APIs to interface with tab and bookmark services. Link filtering uses simple pattern matching for include and exclude rules. The selection mechanism calculates bounding box coordinates and matches link elements with positions inside that box.</p> <h2>Technologies Used</h2> <p>The extension is built using standard web extension technologies including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and browser extension APIs. Modern forks use Manifest V3 compliance and may include additional frameworks for UI configuration screens.</p> <h2>Security and Data Protection</h2> <p>Linkclump requires permission to read page content to detect link elements and to interact with browser bookmarks and clipboard. It does not transmit user data externally. Permissions are limited to the extension context and user controlled settings. Users should review extension permissions when installing.</p> <h2>Performance</h2> <p>Linkclump adds minimal overhead to the browser. Selection and link actions use event driven logic and do not impact page rendering performance. The extension remains idle until user triggers a selection.</p> <h2>Updates and Releases</h2> <p>Linkclump has been updated over time through the Chrome Web Store with incremental versions improving stability and features. Some forks exist that adapt the extension to updated browser APIs and Manifest V3 standards.</p> <h2>Licensing</h2> <p>The original Linkclump code is released under an open source MIT license on repositories such as GitHub. Forks and variants may have their own license terms. Users should review repository licenses for compliance.</p> <h2>Conditions of Use</h2> <p>Linkclump is provided as freeware for browser use. Users are responsible for compliance with browser extension policies and license terms included with the extension package.</p> <h2>Program Limitations</h2> <p>Linkclump only functions within supported browsers and cannot operate outside the browser environment. It does not support complex link selection within application content outside web pages. Some browsers may restrict extension permissions for local file URLs.</p> <h2>Typical Usage Scenarios</h2> <p>Common uses include research sessions where many links must be opened at once, bulk bookmarking tasks, and copying link lists for external analysis or documentation. Linkclump speeds up repetitive link handling tasks typical in web browsing.</p> <h2>Installation and Setup</h2> <p>To install Linkclump, open the Chrome Web Store in a Chromium based browser, search for Linkclump, and click Add to Browser. After installation, access options via the extension icon to configure actions and shortcuts settings before use.</p> <h2>Launching and Usage Instructions</h2> <p>After installation, navigate to a page with multiple links. Hold a configured modifier key and drag the mouse to draw a selection box around links. Release the mouse to trigger the selected action such as opening links in tabs or copying URLs.</p> <h2>User Feedback</h2> <p>Users report that Linkclump improves productivity when handling many links, but some report compatibility issues with evolving browser standards and the need for updated Manifest V3 support in newer browsers.</p>
